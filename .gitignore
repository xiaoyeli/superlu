# Because cmake generates the following file, it can be ignored by git:
SRC/superlu_config.h

# You have to ignore this generated file or git will complain that it is an
# unknown file!
/make.inc

# If the instructions are telling people to create this build dir under the
# source tree, you had better put in an ignore for this.
/build/

.dropbox.attr

# Visual Studio
/.vs
/out/build
